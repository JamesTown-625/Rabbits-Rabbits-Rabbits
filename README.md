Suppose that a scientist is doing some important research work that requires her to use rabbits in her experiments. She starts out with one pair of adult rabbits (a male and a female). At the end of each month, a pair of rabbits produces one pair of offspring (a male and a female). However, these new offspring will not be able to reproduce until they are a month old, and won't have babies of their own until the following month. To illustrate this, consider the first two months:

At the beginning of month one, the scientist just has the original one pair of adult rabbits. The table for month one will look something like

Month	Adult	Babies	Total
1	1	0	1
 

At the end of month one this pair of adults produces one pair of offspring. Thus, at the beginning of month two the table will look like this:

Month	Adult	Babies	Total
1	1	0	1
2	1	1	2
 

At the end of month two the adults have another pair of baby rabbits. The first pair of babies, born at the end of last month are not old enough to have babies yet, but we will categorize them as adults. So, at the beginning of month three the table looks like this:

Month	Adult	Babies	Total
1	1	0	1
2	1	1	2
3	2	1	3
 

The scientist has 500 cages in which to hold her rabbits. Each cage holds one pair of rabbits. Assuming that no rabbits ever die, when will she run out of cages?



Output should look like the following in between the horizontal lines:

Table of rabbit pairs

Month	Adults	Babies	Total
1	1	0	1
2	1	1	2
3	2	1	3
4	3	2	5
5	5	3	8
6	8	5	13
7	13	8	21
8	21	13	34
9	34	21	55
10	55	34	89
11	89	55	144
12	144	89	233
13	233	144	377
14	377	233	610
Cages will run out in month 14.
